Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analysing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet-Chetna Gupta

Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 records
ii. Business table = 10000 records
iii. Category table = 10000 records
iv. Checkin table = 10000 records
v. elite_years table = 10000 records
vi. friend table = 10000 records
vii. hours table = 10000 records
viii. photo table = 10000 records
ix. review table = 10000 records
x. tip table = 10000 records
xi. user table = 10000 records


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =10000 Primary Key: id
ii. Hours = 1562  Foreign Key: business_id 
iii. Category =2643 Foreign Key: business_id
iv. Attribute = 1115 Foreign key: business_id
v. Review =10000  Primary key: id
vi. Checkin =493 Foreign key: business_id
vii. Photo =10000  Primary key: id
viii. Tip = 537 Foreign key: user_id
ix. User = 10000 Primary key: id
x. Friend = 11 Foreign key: user_id
xi. Elite_years = 2780  Foreign key: user_id

3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 
Select * from (Select  id  ,name ,review_count ,yelping_since,useful,funny,cool,fans,average_stars,compliment_hot,
compliment_more,compliment_profile,compliment_cute,compliment_list,compliment_note,
compliment_plain,compliment_cool,compliment_funny,compliment_writer,

funny ||   cool || fans || average_stars || compliment_hot || 
compliment_more || compliment_profile || compliment_cute || compliment_list ||
 compliment_note || compliment_plain || compliment_cool || compliment_funny
  || compliment_writer || compliment_photos is NULL) as result

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
Posing more reviews does not correlate with more fans as there can be user like Mimi with less reviews compared to Gerald but more fans

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
	

	1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
		or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
		the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
		
		
		i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
		
				The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.
				Please note the query returned only three businesses so not a great 
				sample size.
		
		ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
		
			Yes and no, one of the 4-5 star group has a lot more reviews but then the other
			4-5 star group has close to the same number of reviews as the 2-3 star group
		
		iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
			groups? Explain.
	

			No, every business is in a different zip-code.
	

		SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT B.name,
               B.review_count,
               H.hours,
               postal_code,
               CASE
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
                  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
               END AS ord,
               CASE
                  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
                  WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
               END AS rating_grp
        FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
        ON B.id = H.business_id
        INNER JOIN category C
        ON C.business_id = B.id
        WHERE (B.city == 'Las Vegas'
        AND
        C.category LIKE 'shopping')
        AND
        (B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
        OR
        B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
        GROUP BY stars,ord
        ORDER BY ord,rating_grp ASC


2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
	What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
		answer.
			
		i. 	Difference 1:
		
			The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that
			are closed on average.
			
				Open:   AVG(review_count) = 31.757
				Closed: AVG(review_count0 = 23.198
		
		
		ii.	Difference 2:
		
			The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than
			businesses that are closed.
		
				Open:   AVG(stars) = 3.679
				Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
		
		
		SQL code used for analysis:
		
			SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
				   AVG(review_count),
				   SUM(review_count),
				   AVG(stars),
				   is_open
			FROM business
			GROUP BY is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	

i.	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

To find the relation between text of review sentiment and opening of business.
         
         
ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

One of the factors which affect opening of a business are the types of reviews it has. So, for my analysis I require the business name, business open or closed, review text and review count. Through review text I will be able to take out the sentiment of the review. Sentiment will be either positive, neutral or negative based on keywords the text has. If text has positive words like ‘love’, ‘good’ etc then it will be a positive sentiment.
